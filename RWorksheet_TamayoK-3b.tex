. Create a data frame using the table below

\#1A. Write the codes

HouseholdData \textless- data.frame( Respond\_1 = c(1:20),

Sex =
c(``Female'',``Female'',``Male'',``Female'',``Female'',``Female'',``Female'',``Female'',``Female'',``Female'',``Male'',``Female'',``Female'',``Female'',``Female'',``Female'',``Female'',``Female'',``Male'',``Female''),

FatherOccupation =
c(``Farmer'',``Others'',``Others'',``Others'',``Farmer'',``Driver'',``Others'',``Farmer'',``Farmer'',``Farmer'',``Others'',``Driver'',``Farmer'',``Others'',``Others'',``Farmer'',``Others'',``Farmer'',``Driver'',``Farmer''),

PersonAtHome = c(5,7,3,8,5,9,6,7,8,4,7,5,4,7,8,8,3,11,7,6),

SiblingsAtSchool = c(6,4,4,1,2,1,5,3,1,2,3,2,5,5,2,1,2,5,3,2),

TypesOfHouses =
c(``Wood'',``Semi-Concrete'',``Concrete'',``Wood'',``Wood'',``Concrete'',``Concrete'',``Wood'',``Semi-Concrete'',``Concrete'',``Semi-Concrete'',``Concrete'',``Semi-Concrete'',``Semi-Concrete'',``Concrete'',``Concrete'',``Concrete'',``Concrete'',``Concrete'',``Semi-Concrete'')

) HouseholdData

\#1b. Describe the data. Get the structure or the summary of the data

summary(HouseholdData)

\#1c Is the mean number of siblings attending is 5? MeanNumSib
\textless- mean(HouseholdData\$SiblingsAtSchool) IsMean5 \textless-
MeanNumSib == 5 print(IsMean5)

\hypertarget{false}{%
\section{False}\label{false}}

\#1d. Extract the 1st two rows and then all the columns using the
subsetting functions.Write the codes and its output.

ftrac \textless- HouseholdData{[}1:2, {]} print(ftrac)

\#1e. Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column. Write the codes
and its result.

selrowcol \textless- HouseholdData{[}c(3, 5), c(2, 4){]}
print(selrowcol)

\#1f. Select the variable types of houses then store the vector that
results as types\_houses.Write the codes.

types\_houses \textless- HouseholdData\$TypeOfHouses

\#1g. Select only all Males respondent that their father occupation was
farmer. Write thecodes and its output.

MaleFarmers \textless-
HouseholdData{[}HouseholdData\(Sex =="Male" & HouseholdData\)FatherOccupation
== ``Farmer'', {]} print(MaleFarmers)

\#1h. Select only all females respondent that have greater than or equal
to 5 number ofsiblings attending school. Write the codes and its
outputs.

FemGT5Sib \textless-
HouseholdData{[}HouseholdData\(Sex == "Female" & HouseholdData\)SiblingsAtSchool
\textgreater= 5, {]} print(FemGT5Sib)

\#2 Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following
codes:

df = data.frame(Ints=integer(), Doubles=double(),
Characters=character(), Logicals=logical(), Factors=factor(),
stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

print(``Structure of the empty dataframe:'') print(str(df))

\#2a. The data frame is empty

\#3 HouseholdData \textless- data.frame( Respondents = c(1:10), Sex =
c(``Male'', ``Female'', ``Female'', ``Male'', ``Male'', ``Female'',
``Female'', ``Male'', ``Female'', ``Male''), FathersOccupation = c(1, 2,
3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3), PersonAtHome = c(5, 7, 3, 8, 6, 4, 4, 2, 11,
6), SiblingsAtSchool = c(2, 3, 0, 5, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 2), TypesOfHouse =
c(``Wood'', ``Congrete'', ``Congrete'', ``Wood'', ``Semi-Congrete'',
``Semi-Congrete'', ``Wood'', ``Semi-Congrete'', ``Semi-Congrete'',
``Congrete'') ) HouseholdData

\#3a.Import the csv file into the R environment. Write the codes.

write.csv(HouseholdData, file = ``HouseholdData.csv'', row.names =
FALSE) ImporteData \textless- read.csv(``HouseholdData.csv'')

\#3b.. Convert the Sex into factor using factor() function and change it
into integer.{[}Legend:Male = 1 and Female = 2{]}. Write the R codes and
its output.

ImporteData\(Sex <- factor(ImporteData\)Sex, levels = c(``Male'',
``Female'')) ImporteData\(Sex <- as.integer(ImporteData\)Sex)

\#3c.Convert the Type of Houses into factor and change it into integer.
{[}Legend: Wood= 1; Congrete = 2; Semi-Congrete = 3{]}. Write the R
codes and its output.
ImporteData\(TypesOfHouse <- factor(ImporteData\)TypesOfHouse, levels =
c(``Wood'', ``Concrete'', ``Semi-Concrete''))
ImporteData\(TypesOfHouse <- as.integer(ImporteData\)TypesOfHouse)

ImporteData\(TypesOfHouse <- factor(ImporteData\)TypesOfHouse, levels =
c(``Wood'', ``Concrete'', ``Semi-Concrete''))
ImporteData\(TypesOfHouse <- as.integer(ImporteData\)TypesOfHouse)

\#3d.On father's occupation, factor it as Farmer = 1; Driver = 2; and
Others = 3. Whatis the R code and its output?
ImporteData\(FathersOccupation <- factor(ImporteData\)FathersOccupation,
levels = c(``Farmer'', ``Driver'', ``Others''))
ImporteData\(FathersOccupation <- as.integer(ImporteData\)FathersOccupation)

\#3e.Select only all females respondent that has a father whose
occupation is driver. Writethe codes and its output. FemaleDrivers
\textless-
ImporteData{[}ImporteData\(Sex == 2 & ImporteData\)FathersOccupation ==
2, {]} print(FemaleDrivers)

\#3f.Select the respondents that have greater than or equal to 5 number
of siblings attendingschool. Write the codes and its output. GT5Sib
\textless- ImporteData{[}ImporteData\$SiblingsAtSchool \textgreater= 5,
{]} print(GT5Sib)

\#4. Interpret the graph
